INTRODUCTION TO THE GAME

1.  GENERAL

MACHIAVELLI recreates the historical situation of the
fast developing and ever shifting balance of power struggles
in Renaissance Italy. MACHIAVELLI can be played by two
to eight players. The players manuever their forces over the
map in order to conquer neighboring territories while
attempting to fulfill to the game's Victory Conditions.
Information is provided for recreating the balance of power
in four different eras, and for setting up numerous variant
scenarios in each era to provide a large variety of games that
can be played using the same rules.

There are five major Italian powers: The Republics of Florence and
Venice, the Duchy of Milan, the Kingdom of Naples, and the Papacy
(which was very much a secular power in this era). There are three
major foreign powers: Valois France, Hapsburg Austria, and the
Ottoman Turks, all of which are partially shown on the mapboard.
All of these states, singly, or in combination, compete for the
control of the Italian peninsula. Up for grabs are the independent,
non-aligned, and autonomous states and provinces as well as your
opponent's territories.

In MACHIAVELLI, you control the fortunes of one of
eight major powers through a tangled web of intrigues,
bluffs, naked displays of power, and infamous double-
crosses. Through careful planning, skillful negotiating,
and a subtle and unerring sense of timing, you may be able
to accomplish what historically was unattainable-the
unification of Renaissance Italy.

Can you, as the Pope, persuade the Kingdom of Naples
and the Republic of Florence to join in a coalition against
Venice rather than carving up the Papal States? Can you, as
the Duke of Milan, survive a treacherous stab in the back by
the Austrian Hapsburgs (your nominal ally)? Can anyone
stop the French from marching (as they did in real life)
straight down the peninsula to the boot of Italy? If you are
power-mad, treacherous by nature, can lie with a straight
face, and like fast-moving action, then MACHIAVELLI
is the game for you!

New gamers should not be overwhelmed by the length
of this rulebook. Much of the material contained in this
booklet is historical data included to familiarize the reader
with what may be unfamiliar events, and to explain the
workings of the various game mechanics. For this reason,
simple and easily-understood concepts may often require
rather lengthy explanations in order to be perfectly clear
and comprehensive. The rules do not have to be memorized,
only read carefully, and used as a reference to be consulted
when question arise during the course of a game. In
addition, the rules do not have to be learned all at once,
For ease in learning and mastering these rules, they are divided
into sections that can be learned as the player's skill with the game
increases.

II. GAME COMPONENTS

The following items should be included in the box, and are
used for the play of MACHIAVELLI:

A. MAPBOARD: The mapboard shows, in a somewhat
simplified form, the various major provinces and states
of Renaissance Italy, its immediate neighbors, and the
local bodies of water, called "seas". Seas are in light blue,
and are divided from one another by black lines and land
masses. The multi-colored land areas are divided by black
lines into a number of different provinces and states. For
simplicity, these will all be referred to as "provinces"
throughout the rules. Provinces that are grouped together
and are of the same color show the approximate outlines
of the various major powers. Many provinces contain a
solid black square or circle within their boundaries. These
represent cities, the square ones being fortified cities,
and the circular ones being cities which are not fortified.
The black square outlines in some provinces are not cities,
but represent fortresses that are used only in certain
specified scenarios-otherwise, they are ignored. Cities
and fortresses with an anchor symbol next to them are
ports. Cities containing a white number have an enhanced
value that is discussed in the Advanced Rules, but have no
special value in the Basic Rules. Provinces that border on a
sea or seas are sometimes referred to as coastal provinces.

B. UNIT COUNTERS: Contrasting colored die-cut
counters are provided for the play of MACHIAVELLI.
There are two sheets of these extra-thick (for ease of play)
counters, and, when punched out, provide over 600 playing
pieces for the game. These "units" represent the various
military forces available to the opposing sides, as well as
units required by the mechanics of the game. It will be to
your advantage to keep the units separated by color and
type once punched out, as this greatly facilitates set up
and play of the game.

The units of the eight powers in the game are of a color
similar to the color of their provinces on this mapboard.
The military units are further differentiated by bearing
the coat-of-arms of that power. The units of all autono-
mous areas are colored gray, and are printed with a blank
coat-of-arms. Other units are white, and contain a symbol
that shows their type. The military units are distinguished
by type by their shape and by the numbers printed on their
faces. Please examine the samples below, and study the
unit counters to familiarize yourself with them.

1.  Major Power Units:

(Image Description:  Examples of unit counters.)
 a. Fleet Unit:  (Shows a "6" inside a pointed oval shape.)
 b. Army Unit: (Shows a shield shape)
 c. Garrison Unit: (Shows a square)
 d. Control Unit: (In power's color) (Shows a circle)
 e. Assassination Unit: (Optional Rules) (Shows a dagger)

FLEET, ARMY, AND GARRISON
UNITS ARE ALL CALLED
"MILITARY" UNITS.
Country     Color           Coat-of-Arms
--------    -------         --------------
Naples      Blue            (Image Description:  A shield divided into quarters, two with vertical stripes, and two with fleur-de-lis.)
Turks       Light Red       (Image Description: A crescent moon and star.)
Venice      Brown           (Image Description: A winged lion.)
Papacy      Orange          (Image Description: Crossed keys under a papal tiara.)
Austria     Red             (Image Description: A double-headed eagle.)
Florence    Light Brown     (Image Description: A fleur-de-lis.)
Milan       Green           (Image Description: A serpent devouring a human.)
Franice      Yellow         (Image Description: Three fleur-de-lis.)

2.  Autonomous Garrison Unit
(Gray with blank white shield)

(Image Description: A square with a blank shield shape inside.)

3.  Ducat Units: (Advanced Rules)
(White with yellow coins)
Ducats come in various denominations.

(Image Description:  Circular counters with the numbers 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50.)

4. Rebellion and famine units:
(White with symbols)

(Image Description:  "REVOLT" (Advanced Rules) with a clenched fist symbol.  "FAMINE" (Optional Rules) with a skull symbol.)

C. UNIT SORTING TRAYS: Two compartmented plastic trays
are included for use in separating and storing the units after they
are punched out. There are a number of ways in which the trays
can be used:

1.  If the box is stored flat when the game is not in use, simply lay
out the trays in the bottom of the box (the edges of the trays can
be trimmed so they will fit side-by-side, or the last row of pockets
from one tray can be stuck into the last row of pockets on the
other tray). The mapboard and other game components can be
laid on top of these to hold the units in their proper pockets.

2.  If the box is not stored flat, or if it is usually carried on its side
some care must be taken to prevent the units from falling out of
their proper pockets. Either put all the units in the pockets of
one tray, then secure the other empty tray on top of this with
rubber bands, or make cardboard "lids" for the trays by cutting
some cardboard to size, then securing the tops to the trays with
rubber bands or cellophane tape.

D. ORDER SHEET PAD: Each player uses one sheet from this pad
on which to write orders for the military units.

E. RULES AND SCENARIOS MANUAL: This booklet contains all
rules for the play of this game, and the information for the various
scenarios. Additional reference material is also included. For ease in
locating various rules, a Table of Contents is provided inside the
front cover.

F. GAME TABLES CARDS: These two identical cards contain the
charts and tables, plus other material that players will want for
reference during a game. They also contain a Conference Map
which players can use for reference when negotiating with other
players.

G.OTHER COMPONENTS: Not included in the game, but nec-
essary for play, are a pencil for each player to use in marking the
Order Sheets, and a pair of ordinary six-sided dice (needed only
for Advanced Game and Optional Rules).
SET UP AND PREPARATION FOR PLAY

I. SELECTION OF SCENARIO AND SIDES

A. SCENARIO: Select a scenario from the scenario section of this
booklet. All the information necessary for the set up is included
in the individual scenarios. The major scenarios are listed in chrono-
logical order, and the variants of each scenario tell the proper
number of players for that particular variant. Depending on the
number of participating players, you will have to find a variant
for that number. After deciding on a scenario and variant, players
should decide what level of the game they will play (Basic or
Advanced), and which, if any, of the Optional Rules will be used.

B. SIDES: Take one unit from each power that will be used in
the game. Invert these units and mix them thoroughly. Each
player then selects one of these units, the unit determining which
power the player will take.

11. MAPBOARD SET UP

A. MACHIAVELLI can be set up and played on any smooth, level
surface, but a table that is large enough to allow the placement of
the mapboard and all other game materials (Order Sheets, extra unit
counters, dice, etc.) makes the ideal playing area. The players should
be ideally seated around the table in close proximity to their home
provinces.

B. Players should select the units needed for the game, and place
them as designated in the selected variant on the mapboard.
III. ORDER SHEET SET UP

A. All scenarios begin with the Spring Campaign of a particular
year, the year being determined by the scenario. Each Campaign
is individually identified by the season and the year, for instance
"Spring, 1385".

B. The years should be filled in consecutively on the YEAR line
on the Order Sheet. For instance, a game starting in 1385 would
be filled in "1385", "1386", "1387", etc.

C. It is useful for each player to write his name and the name of
his country at the top of the Order Sheet to establish ownership
for that sheet.

BASIC GAME

1.  INTRODUCTION TO THE BASIC GAME

The Basic Game Rules cover all information needed to play
MACHIAVELLI in its simplest form. After reading this section of
the rules, it is suggested that the new player play through the
Introductory Game for further clarification of these rules. The
Basic Game covers the basic mechanics of the game, while the
Advanced and Optional Rules build on the Basic Game to introduce
more topics, and to add additional realism and complexity to
concepts that have already become familiar through the play of the
Basic Game. Not all units are required to play the Basic Game;
the Assassination units, the Ducat units, the Revolt units, and
the Famine units are not used.

II. BASIC FLOW OF THE GAME

The players look over the mapboard, make their evaluation of the
situation, then try to negotiate and make deals with other players
to carry out their plans. Based on the results of their negotiations,
and on their plans, the players then simultaneously and secretly
make notations on their Order Sheets for the individual orders of
their own units. These units are then moved exactly as marked, if
possible, and the conflict resolution takes place as the moves are
made. This cycle is repeated during every Campaign. There is an
additional Phase during the Spring Campaign when new military
units are placed on the mapboard.

III. HOW TO WIN-THE OBJECT OF THE GAME

A To win, a player must gain the control of new provinces,
especially provinces that contain cities. The Campaigns continue,
one after another, until, at the end of a Campaign, one player
controls the required number of cities.

B. For the Basic Game, the winner is the first player to control at
least twelve cities, including all the home country cities and at least
six conquered cities, at the end of a Campaign.

IV. SEQUENCE OF PLAY

Play begins after all set up and preparation is complete. The game is
played in "Campaigns", each Campaign representing the passage of
a season during a year-thus, each year consists of a Spring
Campaign, a Summer Campaign, and a Fall Campaign (there is no
Winter Campaign, as military operations normally ceased during
cold weather in this era), in that order. Each Campaign is divided
into Phases which must be carried out in a specific order. The exact
Sequence of Play, which is repeated during every Campaign of the
game, is in this order:

A. MILITARY UNIT ADJUSTMENT PHASE: This is done only
during Spring Campaigns. During this Phase, all players may place
new military units on the mapboard, or remove excess military
units from the mapboard.

B. NEGOTIATION PHASE: This is done during all Campaigns.
During this Phase, the players may talk to each other, either openly
or secretly, to form pacts, alliances, or plot joint actions.

C. ORDER WRITING PHASE: This is done during all Campaigns.
During this Phase, each player secretly writes the proposed orders
for each of their military units on their Order Sheet. Specific
notations are used to indicate specific movements or actions by each
military unit.

D. ORDER EXECUTION AND CONFLICT RESOLTUION PHASE
This is done during all Campaigns. When all players have completed
writing their orders, all units are simultaneously moved, exactly
as written on the Order Sheets. Although this is considered to be
simultaneous, it is impractical for all players to actually move all
of their units at exactly the same time. For this reason, the players
should read their orders aloud and make their moves in clockwise
order, with conflicts being resolved as they occur.

(Image Description:  Two illustrations.  The first shows two men in armor, one with a sword and shield, the other with a two-handed sword.  The second shows two men talking, one pointing at a map or document.)
V. THE MILITARY UNIT ADJUSTMENT PHASE

A. GAME START: The Military Unit Adjustment Phase is only
performed during Spring Campaigns. The initial set up and place-
ment of military units at the start of a game counts as this Phase
for the first Spring Campaign of the game. (Note that in many cases
this initial set up allows more military units on the mapboard than
would ordinarily be allowed).

B. PROCEDURE: At the start of each Spring Campaign, all players
count the number of cities they control, and the number of military
units they have on the mapboard.

1.  If a player controls more cities than the number of military units
he has on the mapboard, extra military units may be placed on the
mapboard until the total number of military units equals the
number of controlled cities (if possible).
    a. New military units may be placed only in controlled provinces
    that contain a city, and are located in the player's home country.
    They may be placed in either the city or the province, as the player
    desires.
    b. Only one new unit may be placed in each province. They may be
    placed in the province if another unit is already in the city, or in the
    city if another unit is already in the province, but new units may
    not be placed in both the city and in the province.
    c. New units may not be placed in provinces or cities that are not
    part of the player's home country.
    d. Old military units may not be traded for new ones. For instance,
    a player could not remove an army unit from the mapboard and
    replace it with a Fleet unit.
    e. It is possible that a player will not be able to place all the new
    military units allowed. In this case they are simply not placed on
    the mapboard. The number and types of military units provided
    for each major power are the maximum any one player is permitted
    to have in play.
    f. Only new Garrison units may be placed in cities. Army units
    must be placed in provinces. Fleet units may be placed only in
    provinces that contain a port city.

2.  If a player controls less cities than the number of military
units he has on the mapboard, excess units must be removed
until the total number of military units exactly equals the
number of controlled cities. The units to be removed are at the
controlling player's discretion, and can be any military units
he has anywhere on the mapboard.

3.  If the number of military units which a player has on the map-
board exacly equals the number of controlled cities, there are no
changes made to those units.

C. DETERMINING CONTROL: In order to count a city for adding
new military units during a Spring Campaign, a player must control
that city. To do so, the player must control both the city and the
province in which the city is located.

1. To control a city, the player must have a military unit either in
the city or in the city's province, if there are no other player's
military units in either, or be the last player to have had a military
unit in either the city or the province at the same time as there were
no other player's military units in either.
    a. If one player has a military unit in the city while another player
    has a military unit in that city's province, no one controls the city.
    b. If no military unit is in the city, a military unit that enters the
    city's province will automatically control the city. It is not
    necessary to actually enter the city to control it.
    c. For purposes of control, Autonomous Garrison units are treated
    the same as it they were another player's units.
    d. A player controls all provinces listed as being part of his home
    country until an enemy military unit advances into any of them.
2.  Once control is established, a player may move his military units
out, and still retain control as long as no other player's military
units enter the province. For ease in remembering who controls a
province and city, players may mark their unoccupied provinces
with Control units of their color.

D. THE CONTROL OF HOME COUNTRIES: The provinces
controlled by each player at the start of a game constitute their
home countries.

1.  A player who controls no cities in his home country at the end
of a Campaign is eliminated from the game. All of that player's
military units are immediately removed from the mapboard.

2.  To gain complete control of another player's home country, one
player must control all provinces and cities of that other player's
home country at the end of a Campaign.
    a. Once complete control is gained over another player's home
    country, the controlling player may start to use the conquered
    home country as if it were part of his own home country.
    b. New military units may be placed on the mapboard during the
    Military Unit Adjustment Phase in the controlled city-containing
    provinces of the conquered home country. This can be done even
    if control over some of the conquered provinces is lost after the
    complete control is established.
    c. Once a player has established complete control over another
    player's home country (or, over several other player's home
    countries), all provinces of the conquered home countries plus
    the player's original home country would have to be lost for that
    player to be eliminated from the game.
    d. A player who gains complete control over a home country that
    was previously conquered by another player may start to use the
    conquered home country the same as if it were taken from the
    original owner (ie. as if it were part of his own home country).

3.  Note that the general outlines of the various home countries
are denoted by various colors on the mapboard. These vary some-
what in various scenarios, and do not always follow the mapboard
color schemes. Each player's home country provinces are named
in the various scenarios. Home countries that are not used in a
scenario are not treated as home countries in that scenario.

VI. THE NEGOTIATION PHASE

The Negotiation Phases are one of the keys to the successful play
of MACHIAVELLI, as the agreements reached by players during
these periods can have a far-reaching affect on the course of the
game, and on the various strategies each player must adopt. During
the Negotiation Phases, the players may say as much or as little as
they wish. They may openly discuss plans and projects around the
mapboard, or may go off in groups to keep their negotiations secret.
The negotiations may cover threats, bargaining, joint planning, the
exchange of information, the spreading of lies and rumors, etc.
Despite appearances where some powers may seem to be in more
favorable strategic positions than others, the true value of each
power depends to a large extent on the controlling player's skill
in negotiations.

A. During this Phase, the players may negotiate with each other.
Negotiations can include the formation of long-term pacts or
alliances, the plotting of joint actions, and/or the exchange of any
types of information. Negotiations may be carried out publically or
privately-the Conference Maps are provided for reference by
players who wish to move away from the mapboard for private dis-
cussions.

B. The object of negotiations is to influence other players to
cooperate in some ways in various manuevers. What players will
agree to, or demand in return for cooperation is entirely up to the
players involved.
C. Agreements may be made between two players, or among
several players.

D. Players may agree to almost anything that can be legally done
within the framework of the game's rules. They may even support
each other's military units, or transport each other's units by sea.

E. No agreements made in negotiating are binding, even if written
and signed in blood. A player must simply be trusted to honor any
agreements that are made. If a player does not honor an agreement
with you, you are simply out of luck. Determining each player's
honesty is up to the players in the game, and is an integral part of
playing the game.

F. Players may set any desired and convenient time limits for the
Negotiation Phase which they desire and feel proper. Normally,
if you wish a game of under four hour's length, a limit of five to
ten minutes should be set.

G. Although players will undoubtably be talking to each other all
through the game, they should try to restrict halting play in favor
of discussions to only the Negotiation Phase.

VII. THE ORDER WRITING PHASE-MEANING OF THE
ORDERS

A. GENERAL RULES FOR WRITING ORDERS: All military
units are assumed to be carrying out their orders simultaneously.
The orders for each unit must be secretly written on the player's
Order Sheets before any unit is actually moved. It is suggested that
players mark their Order Sheets with pencils, instead of with ink,
to facilitate erasing. After the completion of writing, be sure to
check over the written orders to be sure they are correct, complete,
and legible. All players must use the notation system given in these
rules, so that any other player looking at a notation
would know
exactly what it means.

1.  One of seven possible orders can be written for a military unit.
Each of these orders is expressed by a notation specifying the
particular order given to that military unit. No unit may be given
more than one order during a Campaign. For easy reference, these
Military Orders are listed on the Game Cards.

2.  If necessary, the order notation is followed by the abbreviated
name of the province or sea to which the action is directed. A
province may be abbreviated by using the first five letters (if there
are that many) of its name. For instance, "Otran" is the abbre-
viation for Otranto province. A sea may be abbreviated by using,
capitalized, the first letter of each word in its name. For instance,
"BOT" is the abbreviation for Bay of Tunis, "IS" is the abbreviation
for Ionian Sea, etc.

3.  Orders for a military unit are written in the column of the
current Campaign on the line containing the identification of the
military unit. For instance, the orders for Army unit No. 1 for the
Spring, 1385 Campaign are written in the Spring, 1385 column on
line "A1" ("A1"=Army Unit No. 1). Orders should be written on
all lines corresponding to the player's military units that are current-
ly on the mapboard.

4.  Once the Order Writing Phase is over, no orders can be changed.
Incorrect orders must be followed, if possible. Invalid orders (those
which were written incorrectly, and are impossible to follow) are
ignored, and the units they were written for merely hold.

5.  Players write orders only for their own military units. They may
not write orders for other player's units, or for Autonomous
Garrison units.

6.  Although a player may not write orders for other player's
military units, there are times when, due to agreements reached
during negotiations, a player may wish to write support orders to
aid another player's military unit, or that will transport another
player's Army unit. In these cases, the notation for that other major
power must be written as part of the notation-if no notation of this
type appears, the orders are assumed to automatically apply to the
player's own units. For easy reference, the Major Power Notations
are listed on the Game Tables Cards.

7.  The order that can be given to each type of military unit are
summarized as follows:
    a. FLEET: Fleet units are the only type that can carry out all
    seven possible orders: Advance, Besiege, Hold, Lift Siege, Support,
    Transport, or Convert.
    b. ARMY: Army units can carry out any of six possible orders:
    Advance, Besiege, Hold, Lift Siege, Support, or Convert.
    c. GARRISON: Garrison units are the most limited type, and can
    carry out only three possible orders: Hold, Support, or Convert.

B. THE POSSIBLE MILITARY ORDERS: Each written order gives
specific instructions to the unit to be carried out. These orders are
written during the Order Writing Phase, and performed during the
Order Execution and Conflict Resolution Phase.

1.  ADVANCE (A): This order may be given to a Fleet or an Army
unit. It tells the unit to advance into a specific province or sea. The
name of the province or sea to be entered must be noted, also. For
instance, the notation "A-Capua" orders a unit to advance into the
province of Capua. When this order is carried out, the unit will
actually be moved into Capua province.
    a. A Fleet unit or an Army unit (except when transported) may
    advance only into an immediately adjacent province or sea during
    a Campaign. To be considered adjacent, the province or sea to be
    entered must have a common border with the unit's original
    location.
    b. There may be no more than one Fleet or Army unit in each
    province or sea at one time. There may be no more than one
    Garrison unit in each fortified city or fortress at one time.
    c. Only Garrison units are allowed in fortified cities or fortresses.
    Garrison units are not allowed in provinces or seas. Garrison units
    may not be given orders to advance.
    d. Army units (except when transported-see 6., below) may
    advance only on land, into an adjacent province. They may not
    advance into a sea.
    e. Fleet units may advance from one sea to an adjacent sea; from a
    sea to a coastal province that borders directly on that sea (they are
    considered to be on the coastline); from a coastal province to an
    adjacent sea; and from one province to an adjacent province along
    the coastline. They may not advance from one province to another
    adjacent province if the movement is not along the coastline.
    f. A Fleet unit in a coastal province, or on an island which contains
    a single province (Corsica or Sardinia), can be considered to be any-
    where along that particular coastline. For instance, a Fleet unit in
    Otranto province could advance from there into the Lower Adriatic,
    the Ionian Sea, or the Gulf of Naples.
    6
    g. The presence of a Garrison unit in the fortified city or fortress
    of a province will not prevent any other military unit from entering
    or exiting that province.

2.  BESIEGE (B): This order may be given to a Fleet or an Army
unit. It tells the unit to besiege the enemy-held fortified city or
fortress in the province in which it is currently located. For instance
an Army unit in Florence province that was given the order "B"
would besiege the fortified city located in that province. When
this order is carried out, the unit will be placed under the
Garrison unit in the fortified city.
    a. An Army unit may besiege any fortress or fortified city. Fleet
    units may besiege only fortified cities and fortresses that are ports.
    b. Only one unit may besiege a fortified city at one time. The
    unit counts as the military unit in that province, and no other unit
    may be in the province at the same time.
    c. Units beseiging a fortress or fortified city may be supported.
    3.  HOLD (H): This order may be given to a Fleet, Army, or
Garrison unit. It tells the unit to remain in place (ie. do nothing).
Invalid orders always become hold orders.

4.  LIFT SIEGE (L): This order may be given to a Fleet or Army
unit. It is just the opposite of the besiege order, and tells the unit
to end a siege in which it is currently involved. When this order
is carried out, remove the Fleet or Army unit from under the
Garrison unit, and place it in the province. A unit that is besieging
a fortified city or fortress may not be ordered to advance into
another province until the siege has ended or been lifted.

5.  SUPPORT (S): This order may be given to a Fleet, Army, or
Garrison unit. It tells the unit to support some other unit in carrying
out its orders. The name of the province or sea supported must be
noted, also. For instance, the notation "S-Flore" orders a unit to
support into the province of Florence. A unit with support orders
remains in place-it does not advance into the named province or
sea.
    a. To support, the supporting unit must have the capability to
    actually advance into the province or sea where its support is given.
    This capability to advance may not include being transported.
    In other words, military units may only support into provinces or
    seas that are immediately adjacent. Army units may not support
    into seas. Fleet units may not support into provinces into which
    they could not advance.
    b. Any possible number of military units may be used to support
    into the same province or sea. A single unit may only support into
    one province or sea during one Campaign.
    c. A Garrison unit may be used to support only into the province
    containing its city.

6.  TRANSPORT (T): This order may be given only to a Fleet unit.
It tells the Fleet unit to transport an Army unit by water through
the sea or coastal province it occupies. The name of the Army unit
to be transported must be noted, also. For instance, the notation
"T-A2" orders the Fleet unit to transport Army unit No. 2. When
this order is carried out, the Army unit will actually be moved to
show each Fleet unit used for transport, and then advanced into
the final province.
    a. A Fleet unit may transport only an Army unit, and not more
    than one Army unit per Campaign.
    b. A Fleet unit must remain in place when used for transport.
    A Fleet unit used for transport may take no other actions
    during that Campaign. A transported Army unit must end its
    advance on land in a province.
    c. A transported Army unit may use any possible number of
    Fleet units for transport during one Campaign. An Army unit
    may be transported through any number of contiguous seas and/or
    coastline provinces in a single Campaign if each contains a trans-
    porting Fleet unit. The Army unit's orders should be to advance to
    the desired provinces. A transported Army unit may only be
    given orders to advance; it may not be given orders to support.
    d. A fleet unit may transport an Army unit only into provinces into
    which the Fleet unit itself could legally move.

7.  CONVERSION: This order may be given to a Fleet, Army or
Garrison unit. It tells the unit to convert itself into another type of
unit by naming the new unit. For instance, if the notation "A8"
were written on the Garrison unit No. 3 ("G3") line, this would
indicate that Garrison unit No. 3 is to be converted into Army unit
No. 8. When a conversion takes place, the original unit is removed
from the mapboard, and the new one put in its place-moved either
into the fortified city or fortress, or out into the province, as the
case may be.
    a. Conversions may only take place in provinces which contain
    fortified cities or fortresses.
    b. Only Garrison units are allowed in fortified cities and fortresses.
    Therefore, for a Fleet or Army unit to enter a fortified city or
    fortress, it must be converted into a Garrison unit, then placed
    there. For a Garrison unit to leave a fortified city, it must be con-
    verted into a Fleet or Army unit, then placed in the province.
    c. When a Garrison unit is converted in an inland fortified city or
    fortress, it must be converted into an Army unit. When a Garrison
    unit is converted in a port, it may be converted into either a Fleet
    or an Army unit.
    d. A unit may only be converted once per Campaign. It is not
    possible to convert an Army unit directly into a Fleet unit, or
    vice-versa, during one Campaign, although this could be accomp-
    lished over two Campaigns (ie. converted into a Garrison unit during
    the first Campaign, then into the desired Fleet or Army unit during
    the second Campaign).
    e. Autonomous Garrison units may never leave the city or fortress
    they are placed in at the start of the game. They may never be con-
    verted.
    f. A unit may be ordered to disband by writing "0". In this case,
    the unit is removed from the mapboard (ie. it is converted into
    nothing).
    g. A military unit of one major power may not be given orders to
    convert into a military unit of another major power.
    h. Besieged Garrison unit may not convert.

C. EXAMPLES OF ORDERS FOR MILITARY UNITS: Orders
should be written in this manner: Order Notation-Province or Unit
Notation (if needed) - (Major Power Notation) (if needed). Some
examples are given below:

1.  A-Saler: Unit is ordered to advance into Salerno province.

2.  B: Unit is ordered to besiege the fortified city or fortress in its
province.

3.  H: Unit is ordered to hold and remain in place.

4.  L: Unit is ordered to lift siege and move back into the province.

5.  S-UA: Unit is ordered to support into Upper Adriatic.

6.  S-Arezz-(A): Unit is ordered to support into Arezzo in favor of
the Austrians.

7.  T-A3: Unit is ordered to transport Army unit No. 3.

8.  T-A4-(Fr): Unit is ordered to transport French Army unit No. 4.

9.  F5: Unit is ordered to convert into Fleet unit No. 5.

D. SPECIAL MAPBOARD FEATURES AND RULES: This section
clarifies some of the more unusual sections of the mapboard.

1. PIOMBINO: This province includes the offshore island of Elba.
A Fleet unit in this province controls the straits between the main-
land and the island. An Army unit in this province does not control
the straits. The straits (shown on the mapboard by a broken line)
are not a separate sea, but are part of the Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea.
If they are not controlled by a Fleet unit in Piombino province,
a hostile Fleet unit could move directly from Pisa province to the
Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea, and vice-versa, or transport an Army unit
from one to the other.

2.  SICILY: The island of Sicily is composed of the provinces of
Palermo and Messina. Fleet units may move directly from Bay of
Tunis to Ionian Sea. However, a Fleet unit in Messina province
controls the narrow straits between Messina and Otranto. An Army
unit in Messina does not control the straits, nor does a Fleet or
Army unit in Otranto. As long as there is a Fleet unit in Messina, no
hostile Fleet unit could move directly from Gulf of Naples to
Ionian Sea, or vice-versa, or transport an Army unit from one
of these seas to another.

NOTE CONCERNING PIOMBINO AND MESSINA: If a Fleet unit
is ordered to, and makes, an advance to Piombino or Messina at the
same time as a hostile Fleet tries to move or transport through the
straits, the movement through the straits becomes impossible. As
long as a Fleet unit is in these provinces, no other player's units
may use the straits without the controlling player's permission.

3.  DALMATIA: The islands south of Istria province, and west of
Croatia and Dalmatia are considered to be part of Dalmatia province
Croatia province, therefore, has direct access to the upper Adriatic
only on that part of its coastline that is to the north of Istria
province. A Fleet unit may land on the southern coast of Croatia,
but must first move into Dalmatia or Istria provinces in order to do
so. A Fleet unit may not land on the southern coast of Croatia and
leave from the northern coast, or vice-versa.

4.  PROVENCE Provence province has two separate coastlines
which are separated by Marseille. A fleet landing on one of these
coastlines may not leave from the other.

NOTE CONCERNING CROATIA AND PROVENCE: If any doubt
exist as to which coast these provinces a unit is ordered to ad-
vance to, add the letter "N" for "north coast" or "S" for "south
coast" to specify which coast is intended. For instance, "ProveN"
and "ProveS" are the correct notations for the north and south
coasts, respectively, of Provence.

5.  VENICE LAGOON: The Venice Lagoon, although small, is
treated as a regular sea.

6.  VENICE: Due to its small size, Venice is a province as well as a
city, but may not be used as both at the same time. Thus, it could
contain a Fleet, Army, or Garrison unit, but not more than one unit
at any one time. Because of this it is not possible to besiege Venice.
The anchor symbol in the Venice Lagoon applies only to Venice-
Padua and Treviso are not ports.

7.  MINOR ISLANDS: There are a number of small black islands
shown on the mapboard near Palermo and Sardinia. These play
no part in the game, but are merely decorative.

8.  If a major power is defined as being neutral in a scenario variant,
treat the provinces of that power as if they were not on the map-
board. No units may advance or retreat into those neutral provinces.

9.  No movement allowed between Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea and
Capua. Movement is allowed between Gulf of Naples and Tivoli.

VIII. ORDER EXECUTION AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION
PHASE

A. ORDER EXECUTION: The written orders for the units are now
actually carried out, and the units actually moved on the mapboard.

1.  Order Sheets should be laid out in full view of the other players,
No further notations may be made on the Order Sheets during
this Phase.

2.  The units should carry out their orders exactly as indicated by
their Order Sheet notations, if at all possible. Invalid orders are
changed to hold orders. Other orders may prove impossible to carry
out due to conflicts with other player's units.

3.  The units are all considered to be carrying out orders simultan-
eously, although having all players actually moving all their units
at one time is impractical, so the players should take turns reading
their orders aloud, and carrying them out as they are read. Any
player may start reading orders and carrying them out, with the
other players following in clockwise order. The player who reads
first should be rotated every Campaign. Conflicts should be resolved
as soon as they occur.

4.  ORDER EXECUTION PROCEDURE: The following procedure
should be followed in executing orders:
    a. As each player reads the orders, unopposed advances, etc. are
    made as they are read. Other orders that involve no actual move-
    ment, such as support and hold orders, should be mentioned.
    b. As the orders are read, any players with conflicting orders
    should say so, and the conflicts should be immediately resolved.

B' CONFLICT RESOLUTION: Conflicts occur, and must be
resolved, whenever military units have orders that would cause more
than one unit occupy a single place (province, sea, fortified city, or
fortress) at the same time. Conflicts may occur between forces that
are either equal or unequal in strength. In order for a conflict to
occur, one or more sides must be attempting to advance or convert
into the disputed place, Conflicts may be simple or quite complex,
involving many units. The rules given in this section will apply to all
conflicts.

1.  STRENGTHS: All Fleet, Army and Garrison units are con-
sidered to be exactly equal in strength, all having a strength of
"one".

2.  FORCES: A force may consist of a single military unit, or it may
consist of a single military unit plus all military units which are
supporting the place it is in or to which it is advancing. It should be
noted that, for instance, three separate units all ordered to advance
into the same place constitute three forces, each of a strength of
"one". If only one of those units had orders to advance, while the
other two units had orders to support into that same place, this
would constitute one force with a strength of "three".

3.  CONFLICTS BETWEEN EQUAL FORCES: If the orders of two
or more equal forces conflict, no moves can be made. Below,
specific conflict situtations between equal forces are discussed:
    a. If two or more equal forces are ordered to advance to the same
    place, none of them may enter the place. This is a "standoff'
    situation, and no other units may retreat into the place where the
    advances were prevented.
    EXAMPLE: Opposing Army units in Fornova and Como both have
    orders "A-Pavia". Since they are of equal strength, neither may
    advance into Pavia, and both must remain in their original provinces.
    b. If two equal forces are ordered to advance, each to the place that
    the other occupies, neither may advance.
    EXAMPLE: An Army unit in Bologna has orders "A-Ferra", while
    another Army unit in Ferrara has orders "A-Bolog". Since they are
    of equal strength, and are trying to advance over a common border,
    neither may advance.
    However, if one force successfully advances into a different place
    while another force enters its original place, no conflict occurs.
    EXAMPLE: An Army unit in Bologna has orders "A-Lucca", while
    another Army unit Ferrara has orders "A-Bolog". Since the first
    Army is leaving Bologna at the same time as the second Army is
    entering it, no conflict results.
    c. An equal force ordered to advance into a place already occupied
    by another unit (with orders to besiege, hold, lift siege, transport,
    or convert) may not advance, and the occupying force may carry
    out its orders.
    d. An equal force ordered to advance into a place already occupied
    by another unit with orders to support, may not advance, but the
    occupying unit may not carry out its support orders, unless the
    advance came from the place to which its support was directed.
    EXAMPLE: An Army unit in Bologna has orders "S-Moden", while
    an opposing Army unit in Mantua has orders "A-Bolog". Since they
    are of equal strength, the advance may not be made, but the
    Bologna Army unit may not carry out its support orders (if the
    Mantua Army had been in Modena, the Bologna Army unit could
    have still supported).
    e. A unit with orders to advance that could not do so due to
    conflicting with an equal force, may still prevent another equal
    force from advancing into the place it occupies.
    EXAMPLE: A Fleet unit in Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea has orders
    "A-WTS". A Fleet unit in Western Tyrrhenian Sea has orders "H",
    while another Fleet unit in Gulf of Naples has orders "A-ETS".
    Since the Fleet unit in Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea cannot advance
    against the equal force in Western Tyrrhenian Sea, it must remain
    in its original place, and can prevent the advance of the Fleet unit
in the Gulf of Naples.
    f. A Garrison unit with orders to convert into a Fleet or Army unit
    may not do so if there is an enemy unit of equal force already in the
    province.

4.  CONFLICTS BETWEEN UNEQUAL FORCES: If the orders of
unequal forces conflict, the strongest side will always win. The
player who can bring more units (including supporting units) into a
conflict will win, forcing the weaker force to remain in place or
retreat, as called for in the particular situation. Below, specific con-
flict situations between unequal forces are discussed:
    a. If a superior force is ordered to advance into a place at the same
    time as a weaker force or forces is ordered to advance into the same
    place, the superior force may advance while the weaker forces
    remain where they were.
    b. It a superior force is ordered to advance to a place that an inferior
    force occupies, the superior force may advance, and the inferior
    force must retreat.
    C. If two forces are ordered to advance, each to the place that the
    other occupies, the superior force may advance, and the inferior
    force must retreat.
    d. If a Garrison unit, in the same province with an enemy military
    unit, has orders to convert, and is part of a superior force, it may
    convert, and the enemy military unit must retreat. The Garrison
    unit may not convert if the enemy force is equal or superior, but
    remains in the fortified city or fortress.
    e. If a superior force is ordered to hold a place, and an inferior
    force attempts to advance, the advance may not be made.

5.  CONFLICTS WITH YOUR OWN UNITS: Anytime a player
orders one of his own units into a place already occupied by one of
his own units, the advancing or converting force must hold. A
player may never force one of his own units to retreat.

6.  RETREATS: A military unit is forced to retreat whenever a
superior opposing force is ordered to advance into its province or
sea. Garrison units, in fortified cities or fortresses, may never be
forced to retreat.
    a. A military unit which is forced to retreat may only retreat into
    an unoccupied place it could have ordinarily advanced into (with-
    out using transport)-ie. an adjacent province or sea.
    b. Fleet units may not retreat to an inland province or to a non-
    port city, Army units may not retreat into seas.
    c. Units may retreat to places which are vacated by other units
    during the same Campaign with teh following restrictions:
        1) If a province or sea is not occupied due to a standoff situation,
        it may not be retreated into.
        2) Units may not retreat into the province or sea from which the
        advancing enemy unit came.
        d. If the retreating unit is in a province which contains an un-
        occupied fortified city or fortress, and no other place to retreat
        is available, the retreating unit may be converted into a Garrison
        unit and placed in the city or fortress.
        e. If no place of retreat is available, the unit is eliminated and re-
        moved from play. This includes retreats off the mapboard, or into
        neutral provinces.
        f. A retreat will cancel all orders to advance, besiege, hold, lift
        siege, support, or transport. It will not cancel orders to convert.
        A Fleet or an Army unit that has orders to convert into a Garrison
        unit will do so and enter the fortified city or fortress rather than
        retreating. A Garrison unit that is converting into a Fleet or an
        Army unit will do so, but the unit would then have to immediately
        retreat from the advancing opposing force.
        g. Retreats are carried out as soon as they occur, in the order in
        which they are read out.

C. GARRISONS AND SIEGES: Garrison units do not advance and
retreat in the same manner as Fleet and Army units. This, plus the
fact that Autonomous Garrison units (which no player controls)
exist, requires some special rules for their use.

1.  GARRISON UNITS:
    a. AUTONOMOUS GARRISON UNITS: Certain neutral and auto-
    nomous provinces, which are not powerful enough to field Fleet
    or Army units, yet are not pushover conquests, either, start
    scenarios with Autonomous Garrison units in their fortified cities
    or fortresses. Autonomous Garrison units are passive; no orders
    need be written for them, as they automatically always have hold
    orders. They may not convert or support. They are simply obstacles
    that must be besieged in order to control their provinces.
    b. COMMITTED GARRISON UNITS: A committed Garrison unit
    is one which is controlled by one of the players. Unlike Auto-
    nomous Garrison units, committed Garrison units may convert or
    support. Garrison units which are besieged may not convert. They
    may, however, support into their own province.

2.  SIEGES: A Fleet or Army unit with besiege orders, and which is
placed under the Garrison unit, is "laying siege" to the fortified city
or fortress.
    a. Fortified cities and fortresses that contain a Garrison unit must
    be besieged to be captured. It will require at least three Campaigns
    to successfully beseige a fortified city or fortress.
        1) The unit which is to besiege a city must first advance into the
        province containing the city, if not already there.
        2) On the next Campaign, the unit may be given a besieging order,
        and the unit is placed under the defending Garrison unit to show
        that the place is under siege. Remember that an inland fortified
        city or fortress may only be besieged by an Army unit, but a port
        may be besieged by either a Fleet or an Army unit.
        3) For the following Campaign, the besieging unit should be given
        besiege orders again. If the unit is still in place at the end of that
        Campaign, the Garrison unit is eliminated and removed from the
        mapboard. Once the Garrison unit is removed, the besieging unit
        automatically controls the city or fortress, and is considered to be
        located in the province.
        4) If a unit lifts siege before the sequence is complete, or is forced
        to retreat, the siege fails. To besiege the place again would require
        starting over.
        5) A unit may be in the province with the Garrison unit in its fort-
        ified city or fortress without besieging it. Sieges must be specifically
        ordered, they are not automatic.

IX. THE INTRODUCTORY GAME

This section presents an actual game of MACHIAVELLI being play-
ed, and is intended to help players learn and understand the rules.
New players should set up this situation on their own mapboards,
making the moves as they follow the commentary in this section.

Six Campaigns out of scenario III.A. are played through. Only the
Basic Game rules are being used. This demonstration is not meant
to show a well-played game, or to display a suggested strategy, but
only to show an example of the game actually being played.

INITIAL SET UP: The identifications of the units, and where they
are placed at the start of the game are as follows:

MILAN: Pavia (Al), Milan (A2), Cremona (A3), Bologna (A4),
Genoa (F1).
VENICE: Dalmatia (F1), Ragusa (F2), Venice (G1).
NAPLES: Naples (F1), Salerno (F2), Bari (A1), Aquila (A2).
FLORENCE: Pistoia (A1), Florence (A2), Pisa (F1).

The players are seated clockwise around the mapboard in the order
in which the major powers are listed. Written orders shown for all
Campaigns below will be in the order in which they are read and
carried out. The Negotiations of the players will not be covered,
only the mechanics of their orders.

                                                A-Ancon     A-Bolog

COMMENTS: No orders cause any conflicts, except for the advance
of Florence A2 (supported by Florence A1) into Bologna.Milan A4
retreats into Modena.

SUMMER, 1385:
        Venice   Naples        Florence      Milan
A1              A-Aquil     S-Bolog      A-Genoa

F1   A-Istri       A-Tivol   A-Genoa      B-Savoy
F2   A-Duraz     A-Messi
F3    A-L

COMMENTS: Note how both Milan A1 and Florence F1 tried to
advance into Genoa. Since both were equal in strength, neither
could advance. Milan still controls Genoa, as it was the last power
with a military unit there. Milan A3, with the support of Milan A4
failed to advance into Bologna, as Florence A2 there was supported
by Florence A1--both forces of equal strength.

FALL, 1385:
        Naples         Florence          Milan          Venice
A1      A-Capua        S-Bolog        A-Genoa

F1      B-Tivol        A-Corsi    B-Savoy     A-Crout N
F2      B-Messi                               B-Ouraz
F3                                           A-UA

COMMENTS: Note that Milan A3 again failed to advance into
Bologna. Sieges end in Trent, Savoy, and Ancona, and the Auto-
nomous Garrison units there are eliminated.

SPRING, 1386:
THE MILITARY UNIT ADJUSTMENT PHASE: All players count
the cities they control, and adjust their military units.
FLORENCE: Florence now controls four cities (Pisa, Florence,
Corsica, and Bologna). A3 is placed in Pisa.
MILAN: Milan now controls six cities (Savoy, Genoa, Pavia, Milan,
Trent, and Cremona). A5 is placed in Cremona.
VENICE: Venice now controls five cities (Venice, Croatia, Ragusa,
Dalmatia, and Albania). F4 is placed in Venice, and F5 in Ragusa.
NAPLES: Naples now controls three cities (Naples, Bari, and
Ancona). A1 in Capua must be removed.

        Florence       Milan           Venice      Naples

F5                                                  A-LA

COMMENTS: Milan F1 and Florence F1 both tried to advance into
Eastern Gulf of Lyons. Since they are of equal force, neither may
advance. Florence A3 and Milan A4 both tried and failed (equal
strength) to enter Lucca. The failure of Milan A4 to advance, made
the advance of Milan A1 impossible, also. Sieges end in Messina,
Tivoli, and Durazzo, and the Autonomous Garrison units there
are eliminated.

SUMMER, 1386:

F4                   A-UA
F5                  A-Bari

COMMENTS: Milan A5, supported by two other Army units was
able to advance into Bologna. Florence A2 did not have to retreat,
as it converted into Florence G1, and was placed in the fortified
city.
FALL, 1386:

       Venice         Naples     Florence         Milan

F4    S-Ancon
F5     A-Aquil
G1                                  S-Bolog

COMMENTS: Naples F1 and Venice F2 both tried to advance to
Messina, and, as their strengths are equal, neither may advance.
Venice F3, supported by Venice F4, successfully advanced into
Ancona. Naples A2 retreats into Spoleto. Florence G1 and A3
supported the successful advance of Florence A1 into Bologna.
Milan A5 chooses to retreat into Mantua.

This concludes the commentary and examples of the Introductory
Game. Of course, if this were an actual game, it would continue
until one major power had fulfilled the Victory Conditions.

ADVANCED GAME

I. INTRODUCTION TO THE ADVANCED GAME

It is suggested that players master the rules, concepts, and mech-
anics of the Basic Game before proceeding into the Advanced Game.
A few games played using the Basic Game rules only will make the
mastering of this section of the rules much easier. Most players will
wish to start using these Advanced Game rules as soon as they are
familiar with the Basic Game.

The Advanced Game rules not only modify, extend, and
supplement the Basic Game rules, but also introduce concepts
that are absent in the Basic Game. Their total result is to pro-
duce a more realistic, and also, more complex game. Players
are challenged with more options to consider in making their
decisions that will determine the outcome of the game.

These rules, in most cases, simply add to the Basic Game rules.
All Basic Game rules still apply, unless stated otherwise. All
units are needed for play of the Advanced Game, with the
exception of the Famine units.

II. ADVANCED VICTORY CONDITIONS

A. The Basic Game Victory Conditions may still be used by players
who prefer a fairly short game. The twelve city requirement will
usually result in a game that can be finished in a single evening. For
players who prefer longer, more demanding games, the following
Victory Conditjons are suggested.

B. For four or less players, the winner must control at least
eighteen cities at the end of a campaign, and must have control of at
least one other player's home country.

C. For five or more players, the winner must control at least
fifteen cities at the end of a Campaign, and must have control
of at least one other player's home country.

D. ULTIMATE VICTORY: All the Victory Conditions
mentioned so far make for interesting games, but more or
less ignore the historic goal of the actual participants-to
unify Italy into one state. To do this, the winner must
control at least twenty-three cities at the end of a
and must have control of at least two other player's home
countries. This can result in a very long game, and possibly
one that no player will be able to win (it proved impossible
historically)!

E. SETTING YOUR OWN VICTORY CONDITIONS:
Experienced players may wish to establish their own
Victory Conditions tailored to the type and length of game
they wish to play.

III. ASSASSINATION UNIT SET UP

A. Assassination units are used with the Advanced Game
rules. Each player is given some Assassination units, and a
player must have the appropriate Assassination unit in
order to attempt to assassinate another player. Just the
name of these units gives you an idea of just how rough
games played under the Advanced rules can get!

B. As the game is being set up, each player gives each of the
other players one Assassination unit of the color of the
major power he controls. Thus, each player should start
the game with one Assassination unit for each of the other
players in the game. The players keep these units until they
are used.

IV. ADVANCED GAME SEQUENCE OF PLAY

The following sequence of play, although quite similar to
the one found in the Basic Game rules, incorporates the
new elements found in the Advanced Game rules.

A. MILITARY UNIT ADJUSTMENT AND INCOME PHASE: This
is done only during Spring Campaigns. During this Phase, all players
calculate their incomes, and place or remove military units on the
mapboard.

B. NEGOTIATION PHASE: This is done during all Cam-
paigns. During this Phase, the players may talk to each
other, either openly or secretly, to form pacts, alliances,
plot joint actions, or transfer ducats.

C. ORDER WRITING PHASE: This is done during all Cam-
paigns. During this Phase, each player secretly writes the
proposed orders for each of their military units, and for
each of their ducat expenditures on their Order Sheets.
Specific notations are used to indicate specific movements,
actions, or expenditures.

D. DUCAT EXPENDITURE PHASE: This is done during
all Campaigns. During this Phase, players with expenses
noted on their Order Sheets announce them in the same
order as their moves will be made. As each player takes his
turn reading these orders, he should turn in (spend) an
appropriate value of Ducat units to pay for the expenses.

E. ASSASSINATION PHASE: This is done during all Cam-
paigns. During this Phase, players present Assassination
units to their intended victims, announce the cost and pay
the appropriate value of Ducat units, announce the num-
bers chosen, and roll the die to determine the success of the
attempt. Adjustments are then made on the mapboard to
show the results of any successful assassinations.

F. ORDER EXECUTION AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION
PHASE: This is done during all Campaigns. When all players
have completed writing their orders, all units are simultan-
eously moved, exactly as written on the Order Sheets.
Although this is considered to be simultaneous, it is im-
practical for all players to actually move all their units at
exactly the same time. For this reason, the players should
read their orders aloud and make their moves in clockwise
order, with conflicts being resolved as they occur.

V. FINANCES-INCOME AND MILITARY UNIT COSTS

The rules found in this section replace many of the rules
found in section V (A. and B. of this section are completely
replaced) of the Basic Game rules. These rules place the
raising and disbanding of military units on a financial,
rather than a geographical basis. Players obtain an income
every Spring Campaign, which they can then use
immediately to pay for their current military units or to raise new
military units, or to place in their Treasuries for later use.

A. GAME START: Players compute their income during
the Military Unit Adjustment and Income Plase, which
is only performed during Spring Campaigns. The initial set up
and placement of military units at the start of the game
counts as this Phase for the first Spring Campaign of the
game.

1.  For this first Spring Campaign, players must set up their
military units as given in the scenarios. They may not
change the unit types or their locations.

2.  Players then compute their incomes in the normal way,
including variable income.

3.  Players must then pay for all their military units, if at
all possible. If there is not enough income available to pay
for all military units, a player may remove any excess unit
or units that cannot be paid for. No new military units may
be placed on the mapboard during this initial set up, even
if income is available to pay for them.

4.  All surplus income may be taken in Ducat units, and
forms each player's starting Treasury.

B. PROCEDURE FOR COMPUTING INCOME: At the
start of each Spring Campaign, all players compute their
individual incomes, which are based on the number of
cities, provinces, and seas they control. Income is com-
puted in terms of "ducats" according to a combination
of fixed and variable formulas that, together, show each
player's economic power. The top of the Spring Cam-
paign columns on the Order Sheets is set up to aid in
computing income. Unspent ducats are represented and
recorded by the players taking Ducat units of the
appropriate denominations, and keeping them. Each
player's unspent Ducat units are known as his Trea-
sury. These Ducat units are taken out of play as they are
spent.

1.  SOURCES OF INCOME: There are four sources of
income

    a. BODIES OF WATER: A player receives one ducat
    of income for each sea that contains one of his Fleet
    units.
    b. PROVINCES: A player receives one ducat of income for
    each province he controls.
C. CITIES: A player receives income for each city he controls.

1) NORMAL CITIES: A player receives one ducat of income for
each normal city, both fortified and unfortified, he controls.
2) MAJOR CITIES: Major cities are those which contain a white
number. The number indicates the number od ducats of income
each major city is worth. A player receives the ducat income for
each major city he controls.
    d. VARIABLE INCOME: In addition to the fixed income sources
    listed above, each major power has a variable state income, and, in
    specific scenarios, some individual major cities also have a variable
    income. The Variable Income Chart on the Game Tables Card is
    used to determine the variable income. Depending on the home
    country or city, and on the scenario being played, players may roll
    either one or two dice to determine their variable incomes.
        1) To determine variable income, the player should find the name
        of the home country or city on the Variable Income Chart.
        2) Roll one die. Crossgrid the number rolled with the name of the
        appropriate home country or city. The number found on the Chart
        is the number of ducats of variable income. If two dice are to be
        used, roll each one separately, find the number of ducats for both
        rolls, and add both amounts for the total variable income from that
        one source. Use separate lines on the Chart and separate die rolls
        for each when variable income is from several sources (several
        home countries or major cities).
        3) When a player gains control of another player's home country,
        the control of the variable income of that home country is also
        gained, and may be rolled for separately.

2.  COMPUTING TOTAL INCOME: As players determine their
incomes from each of the four sources, they should write down the
number of ducats from each on the appropriate lines of the
"Finances" sections of their Order Sheets. These four lines should
then be added together, and the sum written on the "Total Income"
line. It can be readily seen that a player's income will change from
year to year, depending on what is controlled, and what the die
rolls are for variable incomes.

3.  MILITARY UNIT PAYMENT: Once the total income is comput-
ed, the player must pay three ducats for each military unit he has on
the mapboard, or new military unit he wishes to place on the map-
board.
    a. There are no limits how many or how few military units a player
    may have on the mapboard. The only requirement is that three
    ducats must be paid for each unit a player has on the mapboard.
    Military units may be removed from the mapboard and/or added
    during the Military Unit Adjustment and Income Phase.
    b. New military units may be placed only in controlled provinces
    that contain a city, and are located in the player's home country.
    They may be placed in either a fortified city or the province, as the
    player desires.
    c. Only one new unit may be placed in each province. They may
    be placed in the province if another unit is already in the city,
    or in a fortified city it antoher unit is already in the province, but
    new units mav not be placed in both the city and the province.
    d. Old military units may not be traded for new ones in that same
    province. However, a player could remove a unit from one province
    or city (ie. not pay for it), and then place that same or another
    military unit in another province or city.
    e. It is possible that a player will not be able to place all the new
    military units desired. In this case they are simply not placed on
    the mapboard. The number and types of military units provided
    for each country are the maximum any one player is permitted
    to have in play.
    f. Only new Garrison units may be placed in fortified cities. Army
    units must be placed in provinces. Fleet units may be placed only in
    provinces that contain a port city.
    g. The number of military units a player may place is in no way
    connected with the number of cities controlled, as in the Basic
    Game, but depends entirely on how many can be paid for.
    h. Once the military units are paid for, they are paid for the entire
year. No further ducats need be paid for the units for the rest of the
year, but, also, no "refunds" of ducats can be made for units that
may be eliminated or disbanded during the year.

i. Once a player has placed all his military units on the mapboard,
he should write the total number of ducats paid for them on the
"Units X 3" line of the "Finances" sections of their Order Sheets.

4.  SURPLUS INCOME: Subtract the number of ducats paid for
military units from the total income, and write this figure on the
"Surplus" line of the "Finances" section of the Order Sheet. This
figure may be either a positive ("+") or negative ("-") number,
depending on whether the "Total Income" was larger or smaller
than the "Units X 3".
    a. If the number of surplus ducats is positive, the player should
    take Ducat units equal in value to the surplus and place them in his
    Treasury.
    b. If the number of surplus ducats is negative, the player must
    take Ducat units equal in value to the surplus from his Treasury,
    and pay them to make up the difference. A player may not have a
    negative surplus if there are not enough Ducat units in the Treasury
    to make up the difference.

C. DETERMINING CONTROL: Control of a city, province, or
home country is determined the same as in the Basic Game rules,
with the following modifications:

1.  If one player has a military unit in the city, while another player
has a military unit in that city's province, the player in the city
would receive the city's income, while the other player would
receive the income of the province.

2.  A besieged fortified city produces no income.

3.  A province and ungarrisoned city containing a Famine unit (see
Optional Rule III.B.) or a Rebellion unit does not produce any
income. A fortified city with a Garrison unit in a province contain-
ing a Famine or Rebellion unit will still produce income for the
controlling player, although the province will produce no income.

4.  When a player is eliminated from the game, all of his Assassina-
tion and Ducat units are also removed from the game.

VI. FINANCES-EXPENDITURES

The rules in this section cover the various ways in which Ducats may
be spent, how they are spent, how many must be spent, and the
results of these expenditures.

A. GENERAL RULES FOR WRITING EXPENDITURE ORDERS:
Expenditure orders are noted on the Order Sheet during the Order
Writing Phase, at the same time as orders are written for the military
units.

1.  Expenditures orders are written in the appropriate Campaign
column on the lines labeled "Expenses" on the Order Sheets. There
are only four lines in this section, and a player may make no more
than four expenditure orders per Campaign, one order per line.

2.  One of twelve possible expenditures orders can be written on
each line. Each of these orders is expressed by a notation ("A"
through "L") specifying the particular order. For easy reference,
these orders are listed on the Expenses Table on the Game Tables
Card. The order notations are always followed by a notation
indicating the province, unit, or major power to which the order
is directed, and the number of ducats to be spent.

3.  As in orders for military units, no expenditure orders can be
changed after the end of the Order Writing Phase. Incorrect orders
must be followed, if possible, and invalid orders are ignored;
although, in both cases, the ducat costs must still be paid, even if
wasted.

4.  There is no requirement for a player to make any expenditures
during a Campaign; doing so is completely voluntary.

B EXECUTION OF THE EXPENDITURE ORDERS: All written
expenditure orders are actually carried out during the Ducat
Expenditure Phase, with the exception of assassination orders,
which are carried out during the Assassination Phase.

1.  Order Sheets should be laid out in full view of the other players.
No further notations may be made on the Order Sheets during the
Ducat Expenditure, Assassination, or Order Execution and Con-
flict Resolution Phases.

2.  The expenditure orders should be carried out exactly as
indicated by the Order Sheet notations, if at all possible.
Invalid orders and those which are impossible to carry out
are ignored, although the ducat cost must still be paid.

3.  The expenditure orders are all considered to take place simul-
taneously, within their proper Phases (since the Assassination
Phase takes place after the Ducat Expenditure Phase, all other
expenditure orders will be carried out before any assassination
orders). Again, as with the military unit orders, the players should
take turns reading their expenditure orders, in the same clockwise
manner as the military unit orders are read.

4.  ORDER EXECUTION PROCEDURE: The following procedure
should be followed in executing expenditure orders:
    a. As each player reads his expenditure orders, the number of
    spent should be taken from the player's Treasury, and removed
    from the game.
    b. The orders should be read and carried out. Any players with
    conflicting orders should say so, and any conflicts immediately
    resolved.

C. THE POSSIBLE EXPENDITURE ORDERS: Each written
expenditure order gives specific instructions, and will cause a
specific result, often requiring special rules.

1.  FAMINE RELIEF (A): This is only used when the Optional
Famine rules (Optional Rule III.B.) are used. This order is given to
end the effects of famine in a province. The name of the province
must also be noted. The cost for this order is three ducats. When
this order is carried out, the Famine unit in that one province
is removed from the mapboard.

2.  PACIFY REBELLION (B): This order is given to end the effects
of rebellion in a province. The name of the province must also be
noted. The cost for this order is twelve ducats. When this order is
carried out, the Rebellion unit in that one province is removed from
the mapboard, and the province return's to its former owner's
complete control.

3.  COUNTER-BRIBE (C): This order is given to try to nullify a
suspected bribe attempt. The name of the unit the counter-bribe
affects must also be noted. A counter-bribe may be any number of
ducats in units of three ducats (ie. three, six, nine, or twelve ducats,
etc.).
    a. If a unit has a bribe and a counter-bribe ordered for it during
    the same Campaign, the number of ducats spent on the counter-
    bribe is subtracted from the number of ducats spent on the
    bribe. If the remaining number of bribe ducats are too few to
    carry out the ordered bribe, it fails.
    b. If several bribes are directed at the same unit during the same
    Campaign, the number of counter-bribe ducats need only be
    subtracted from the largest bribe. All smaller bribes are auto-
    matically wasted and cannot be used.
    c. Counter-bribes are only effective against bribes. They may not
    be used against rebellion or assassination orders.
    d. If a counter-bribe is ordered for another player's military unit,
    be sure to include the major power notation. If a counter-bribe is
ordered for an Autonomous Garrison unit, list the name of the
province (since these units are not identified).

4.  BRIBES: Expenditure orders noted as "D" through "I" are
collectively called "bribes". Each of these bribes is directed at a
specific enemy or Autonomous military unit in a province or sea,
which must be listed in addition to the number of ducats spent.
Successful bribe orders may cancel the military orders given to the
same unit.
    a. DISBAND AUTONOMOUS GARRISON (D): This order is
    given to try to disband an Autonomous Garrison unit. The name of
    the province containing the unit must also be noted. The minimum
    cost for this order is six ducats. If successful, the bribe will cause
    the Autonomous Garrison unit to be disbanded and removed from
    the mapboard.
    b. BUY AUTONOMOUS GARRISON (E): This order is given to
    try to convert an Autonomous .Garrison unit into one of your own
    Garrison units. The name of the province containing the unit must
    also be noted, and the unit it is converted to must be noted. The
    minimum cost for this order is nine ducats. If successful, the bribe
    will cause the Autonomous Garrison unit to be converted into one
    of your own Garrison units.
    C. COMMITTED GARRISON TO AUTONOMOUS (F): This order
    is given to try to convert a committed Garrison unit (one which is
    controlled by another player) into an Autonomous Garrison unit.
    The name of the province containing the unit must also be noted.
    The minimum cost for this order is nine ducats. If successful, the
    bribe will cause the committed Garrison unit to be converted into
    an Autonomous Garrison unit
    d. DISBAND COMMITTED GARRISON (G): This order is given
    to try to disband a committed Garrison unit. The name of the pro-
    vince containing the unit must also be noted. The minimum cost
    for this order is twelve ducats. If successful, the bribe will cause
    the Garrison unit to be disbanded and removed from the mapboard.
    e. DISBAND ARMY OR FLEET (H): This order is given to try to
    disband a Fleet or Army unit. The name of the province containing
    the unit must also be noted. The minimum cost for this order is
    twelve ducats. If successful, the bribe will cause the Fleet or Army
    unit to be disbanded and removed from the mapboard.
    f. BUY ARMY OR FLEET (1): This order is given to try to convert
    an enemy Fleet or Army unit into one of your own Fleet or Army
    units. The name of the province containing the unit must also be
    noted, and the unit it is converted to must be noted. The minimum
    cost for this order is eighteen ducats. If successful, the bribe will
    cause the unit to be converted into one of your own units of the
    same type (ie. A Fleet unit must be converted into a Fleet unit,
    and an Army unit into an Army unit).
    g. SPECIAL BRIBE RULES:
        1) If several different bribes are ordered on the same unit, the
        largest bribe is the only one that is considered-all smaller bribes
        are ignored and wasted. If there is a tie as to which is the largest
        bribe. all bribes to that unit fail and are wasted.
        2) Bribes can be larger than the minimum costs listed, but all
        increases must be in units of three ducats. Often, larger than
        minimum bribes are used to offset suspected counter-bribes.
        3) The minimum cost for all bribes on Garrison units (Autono-
        mous and committed) in major cities is doubled.
        4) A player may direct bribes only into provinces or seas that
        are directly adjacent to one of that player's military units.
        5) A player who orders a bribe to buy a military unit (orders
        "E" or "I") may also write military orders to the unit it is
        converted into on that same Campaign. Thus, if the bribe
        succeeds, the military unit may be placed on the mapboard
        immediately, and start carrying out military orders during the
        Order Execution and Conflict Resolution Phase of the same
        Campaign.
        6) The size of the bribe must be large enough to carry out the
        specified bribe order. Even if the amount of the bribe is large
        enough to carry out another, cheaper, bribe, if there are not
        enough ducats for the ordered bribe, it fails.

5.  REBELLIONS: Expenditures orders "J" and "K" are concerned
with rebellions. These orders may be used against any enemy-
controlled province, even ones which contain a military unit.
Rebellion units may not be placed in seas. If the province contains
a fortified city (or fortress, when these are used), and no Garrison
unit is in the city or fortress, the Rebellion unit may be placed in
the city or fortress. Otherwise, it is placed in the province and kept
there, even if the Garrison unit later leaves the city or is eliminated.
    a. CONQUERED PROVINCE TO REBEL (J): This order is given
    to start a rebellion in an enemy-controlled province that is not part
    of his home country (ie, it has been conquered). The name of the
    province must also be noted. The cost for this order is nine ducats.
    When this order is carried out, a Rebellion unit is placed in the
    province.
    b. HOME PROVINCE TO REBEL (K): This order is given to start
    a rebellion in an enemy-controlled province that is part of his home
    country. The name of the province must also be noted. The cost
    for this order is fifteen ducats. When this order is carried out, a
    Rebellion unit is placed in the province.

NOTE: When placing a Rebellion unit, also place a Control unit of
the color of the player who controlled the province at the start of
the rebellion to indicate who the rebellion is directed against.

   c. SPECIAL RULES ON REBELLIONS: A province or city con-
    taining a Rebellion unit is said to be in "rebellion", to have "rebel-
    led", or to be "rebelling".
        1) Rebellion units may never move, but always remain where
        originally placed. They are never given any written orders. A
        Rebellion unit remains on the mapboard until the rebellion is
        pacified, put down, or liberated.
        2) Rebellion units have no effects on movement. Military units may
        move into, out of, or through (if being transported along a coast-
        line) one rebelling province into another.
        3) Income cannot be collected from a province and/or city contain-
        ing a Rebellion unit, although a garrisoned city in a rebelling pro-
        vince could still provide income.
        4) Plague (see Optional Rule III.A.) does not effect Rebellion units.
        5) A rebellion in a province or city may be pacified by using expen-
        diture order "B" (Pacify rebellion; cost twelve ducats). When this is
        done the Rebellion unit is removed from the mapboard, and the
        place reverts to its former owner's control.
        6) A rebellion may be put down in a province if a military unit of
        the major power that formerly controlled the province enters or is
        in the province and remains there with hold orders for a Campaign.
        At the end of the Campaign at hold orders, if the Fleet, Army or
        Garrison unit remains in the province, the Rebellion unit is removed
        from the mapboard.
        7) To put down a rebellion in a fortified city or fortress, the city
        or fortress must be besieged in the normal manner. The Rebellion
        unit is removed at the conclusion of the siege, the same as if it were
        a Garrison unit.
        8) To liberate a rebellion, a military unit of any major power other
        than the one which formerly controlled the province must advance
        into the rebelling province. The Rebellion unit, whether in the city
        frotress, or province is immediately removed from the mapboard
        when this is done.
        9) Any player other than the one to which a rebellion is directed
        against may use a Rebellion unit for support of an advance into the
        rebelling province. This support is automatic, and need not be
        written down. For this one purpose only, a Rebellion unit has a
        strength of "one". However, if two or more players claim support
        from one Rebellion unit, none may use it.
        10) If two or more rebellion orders are directed against the same
        province during one campaign, only one counts (the others are
        wasted), and only one Rebellion unit is placed.
        11) SPECIAL NOTE: No Rebellion unit may be placed in Venice if
        there is a military unit already there, either in the city or in the
        province.

6.  ASSASSINATIONS (L): This order is given to attempt to
"assassinate" another player. The notation for the major power that
the intended victim controls must also be noted. The player order-
ing an assassination must have an Assassination unit of the color of
the major power that the intended victim controls in order to make
the attempt. The minimum cost for an assassination attempt is
twelve ducats. When this order is carried out, a die is rolled to deter-
mine the success or failure of the attempt. Note that these orders
are carried out during the Assassination Phase.
    a. For every twelve ducats spent on the attempt, the player may
    select one number on the die. For instance, if a player paid twenty-
    four ducats, any two numbers on the die could be selected (for
    instance, "2" and "6" might be selected). The exact numbers
    selected can be announced when the attempt is made, just before
    the die is rolled, they do not have be listed when the order is
    written. No more than three numbers may be selected per attempt,
    so that the maximum number of ducats spent on a single Assaaaina-
    tion attempt is thirty-six.
    b. When, during the Assassination Phase, the attempt is made, the
    player must show the Assassination unit to his intended victim, then
    remove it from play. Each Assassination unit may be used only
    once per game. The numbers on the die are selected, and the die is
    rolled. If the number rolled is not an announced number, the
    Assassination attempt fails. If the number rolled is one of the
    announced numbers, the Assassination attempt succeeds.
    c. More than one player could make an Assassination attempt on
    the same player during the same Campaign. Each would be handled
    separately, with a separate die roll and use of an Assassination unit.
    However, two or more successful assassinations on the same player
    in the same Campaign will have no more effect than one successful
    assassination.
    d. If an assassination is successful, all the victim's military units
    are paralyzed for that one Campaign. All of their orders are automa-
    tically changed to hold orders, although they still may be supported
    by other player's units. The victim's military units may not use their
    hold orders to put down rebellions during this Campaign, and the
    effects of siege are ignored on fortified cities or fortresses that these
    units may be besieging. The victim may resume the normal writing
    of orders on the next Campaign.
    e. If an assassination is successful, any of the victim's Garrison
    units that are being besieged will immediately be removed from the
    mapboard.
    f. For a successful assassination, it must also be determined how
    many of the victim's provinces take advantage of the assassination
    to rebel. The victim must consult the Assassination Rebellion Table
    on the Game Tables Cards, and roll the die once for each controlled
    province. The Table lists the types of provinces and the numbers
    that must be rolled on the die for their rebellion. A Rebellion unit
    is placed in each province where this takes place, and the normal
    rebellion rules apply.
    g. An assassinated player is not out of the game, but stays in the
    game representing his own "successor" as ruler of the major power.
    The effects of assassination merely show the often chaotic effects of
    a sudden shift in power at the top.

D. EXAMPLES OF EXPENDITURE ORDERS: Expenditure orders
should be written in this manner: Order Notations-Province and/or
Unit Notation or Major Power Notation (as needed) -Number of
Ducats Spent. Some examples are given below:

1.  A-Capua-3d: Orders for famine relief in Capua; three ducats
spent.

2.  B-Veron-12d: Orders to pacify rebellion in Verona; twelve
ducats spent.

3.  C-A1-3d: Order to counter-bribe Army unit No. 1; three
ducats spent.

4.  C-A4(FL)-6d: Orders to counter-bribe Florentine Army unit
No. 4; six ducats spent.

5.  C-Forno-3d: Orders to counter-bribe an Autonomous Garrison
unit in Fornova; three ducats spent.
6.  D-Bresc-6d: Orders to disband an Autonomous Garrison unit
in Brescia; six ducats spent.

7.  E-Perug-G3-9d: Orders to buy an autonomous Garrison unit
in Perugia; convert it into Garrison unit No. 3; nine ducats spent.

8.  F-Mantu-9d: Orders to convert the committed Garrison unit in
Mantua into an Autonomous Garrison unit; nine ducats spent.

9.  F-Naple-18d: Orders to convert the committed Garrison unit
in Naples into an Autonomous Garrison unit; eighteen ducats spent
(note that the minimum cost is eighteen ducats, instead of only nine
ducats, since Naples is a major city).

10.G-Romag-12d: Orders to disband the committed Garrison unit
in Romagna; twelve ducats spent.

11.H-LA-12d: Orders to disband the Fleet unit in Lower Adriatic;
twelve ducats spents.

12.I-Pisto-A7-21d: Orders to buy the Army unit in Pistoia; con-
vert it into Army unit No. 7; twenty-one ducats spent.

13.J-Genoa-9d: Orders to the conquered province of Genoa to
rebel; nine ducats spent.

14. K-Messi-15d: Orders to the home province of Messina to rebel;
fifteen ducats spent.

15.L-(N)-24d: Orders to assassinate the player controlling the
major power of Naples; twenty-four ducats spent (enough to choose
two numbers on the die).

E. LOANS, GIFTS, ETC.: Ducats can be given away or loaned
(possibly with interest) to other players at your discretion, by
merely handing them the appropriate Ducat units. Players may give
or sell Assassination units to other players. Repayment of loans, like
keeping any other agreements in this game, must depend on the
borrower's goodwill and integrity. Obviously, the Advanced Game
rules open whole new vistas of topics for negotiations. Probably the
ultimate possible treachery in the game is to borrow money from a
player then turn around and use it for his assassination!

OPTIONAL RULES

I. INTRODUCTION TO THE OPTIONAL RULES

This portion of the rules builds further on the rules found in the
Advanced Game, and adds some further concepts to the rules. Use
of these rules adds greater scope and realism to the game. The
sections of the Optional Rules are separate, and most can be used
either alone or in conjunction with the other sections. The indivi-
dual players must decide for themselves which of the Optional
Rules to use in a game. They may wish to try none of them, one
of them, just some of them, or all of them; it is totally up to the
players involved, what interests them, and the circumstances of the
game.

II. SEQUENCE OF PLAY WITH ALL OPTIONAL RULES

This section is a modification of the Advanced Game rules, expand-
ed to cover the use of all options. If some rules are not in use, the
portions of the sequence pertinent to them can be ignored.

A. FAMINE PHASE: This is only done during the Spring Campaign.
Provinces struck by famine are determined, and Famine units placed
in them.

B. MILITARY UNIT ADJUSTMENT AND INCOME PHASE: This
is the same as in the Advanced Game rules.
money, and are highly susceptible to bribes, as their allegiance went
to the highest bidder. Some military units of different composition
did appear during this time, and the rules in this section cover these
types.

A. No major power may have more than one special military unit
on the mapboard at the same time. The identification of any such
military unit must be specified and made known to all players. The
special unit may be a Fleet, Army, or Garrison unit.

B. CITIZEN'S MILITIA: This type of force, composed of patriotic
citizens, was the type envisioned by Machiavelli. Since they were
not full-time soldiers, they were usually not as well-trained as
mercenaries, but more highly-motivated and enthusiastic.

1.  This type of unit costs six ducats, instead of the normal three.

2.  This type of unit has the usual strength of "one" for conflicts.

3.  This type of unit costs twice the normal amount to bribe.

C. ELITE MERCENARIES: Some mercenary units were more
effective and fought harder and better than other mercenary forces.
The famous Swiss pikemen were mercenaries of this type.

1.  This type of unit costs six ducats, instead of the normal three.

2.  This type of unit has a doubled strength of "two" for conflicts.

3.  This type of unit may be bribed for normal amounts.

D. ELITE PROFESSIONALS: Toward the end of the period
covered in the game, units of long-term professional citizen
soldiers began to appear. The Spanish infantry, recruited from
Spanish citizens to fight for Spain, and well-trained and equipped,
were noted as the best soldiers in Europe. They provide the
best example of this type.

1.  This type of unit costs nine ducats, instead of the normal three.

2.  This type of unit has a doubled strength of "two" for conflicts.

3.  This type of unit costs twice the normal amount to bribe.

V. OPTIONAL BRIBERY RULES

In the Advanced Game bribery rules, bribes may only be directed
into provinces or seas that are adjacent to the player's own military
units. Here are two options on how this rule may be modified, if
players wish.

A. Using the first option, a player may also bribe units that re
adjacent to some other player's military units, but not to his own,
but only with the permission of that other player.

1.  The player should negotiate for permission, then write the bribe
order on the Order Sheet in the normal manner.

2.  During the Ducat Expenditure Phase, the player reads the bribe
order in the normal manner, and also states whose permission he has
to make the bribe. The player who gave permission must then con-
firm that this is so. Then the order is carried out normally. If the
other player fails to confirm the permission, the order (and the
ducat value spent) is wasted-remember, you cannot really trust
anyone.

B. Simply permit players to direct bribes into any provinces,
whether they are adjacent to any military units, or not. Use of this
option can produce some wild situations.

VI. OPTIONAL ASSASSINATION UNIT SET UP

A. This option may be used instead of the set up given in the
Advanced Game rules (section III).

B. As the game is being set up, each player takes a number of
Assassination units of his color equal to the number of other players
in the game. All these units are placed together, inverted so that
the colors cannot be seen, and mixed up thoroughly. The players
then take turns selecting one of these units at a time until all have
been selected. Players may keep what colors they select a secret.
What colors are drawn can often help determine a player's strategy.
The Assassination units are used normally in the game.

VII. OPTION WHEN PLAYER QUITS THE GAME

If a player has to leave the game before it is finished, remove all
of his military units from the mapboard. Then place an Autono-
mous Garrsion unit in every fortified city and fortress (if used)
that player controlled. Continue normal play after this is done.

VIII. DISTANT PLAY RULES

These rules outline a system to permit players to play a game with
each other by phone or by mail, if they are unable to assemble for
face-to-face play, or simply prefer to play at a distance. To use this
system, all players must set up their own copy of the game, then
either send their moves by mail, or read them over the phone.

A. THE JUDGE: This option presumes (perhaps a bit too optimist-
ically) that an extra person can be obtained who will not actually
play in the game for any side, but will serve as "Judge", and run the
game. All orders from all players must be sent or called to the Judge,
who needs to have his own copy of the game set up, plus other
notes that the Judge may require (ie. the number of ducats current-
ly in the Treasury, notes regarding player agreements, loans, gifts,
or the borrowing of ducats, plus any other information that may
help the Judge in carrying out orders.)

B. The game is played similarly to the face-to-face version, but
all needed information must be funneled through the Judge.
The Judge handles all dice rolling, and carries out all orders for
the players, resolving conflicts and determining the directions
of retreats. The Judge must then make a list of the locations
of all units, including military, Famine, and Rebellion units,
and send or read this list back to all players, so they may make
proper adjustments to their own mapboards. If played by mail,
the Order Sheets should be sent back with this list to write
orders for the next Campaign.

C. The Judge will wish to carry out the famine, plague, and
variable income dice rolls and record the results prior to sending
or calling back the unit placements in the appropriate Campaigns.

D. The great advantage in Distant Play is that the players can
communicate individually and secretly by phone or mail without
the knowledge of other players. Players involved in these games
should take full advantage of this in their negotiations.

E. The Judge should set deadlines on when orders from all players
must be received. Generally, every night or two is fine for games
played by phone, but two to four weeks should be allowed for mail
games to give players time to negotiate properly. Any player who
does not get his orders in by the deadline, has automatically no
expenditure orders, and only hold orders for all military units.

F. STANDARD SET UP: This rule is unnecessary in a face-to-face
game, but will help players determine exactly what military unit
is set up in what province to start the game.

1.  Set up military units so that their numbers are consecutive by
type in the order they are listed in the scenario set ups. For
instance, in scenario III.B., Naples would be set up with Army unit
No. 1 in Bari, Fleet unit No. 1 in Naples, Army unit No. 2 in
Messina, and Fleet unit No. 2 in Palermo.

2.  If one player controls more than one major power, and is using
one set of units for all of them, set up consecutively by type in
the order in which the major powers are listed in the scenario set up.

IX. LUCK

The Basic Game contains no dice rolling, and, therefore, has no
random luck element-the results are totally due to the interactions
of the players. Dice rolling is introduced in the Advanced Game
rules and Optional Rules, so that a degree of random luck is present
in these versions. This option is for players who wish to eliminate
the random luck element from the game.

A. Do not use the Assassination rules. Use no Optional Rules that
require the use of a die.

B. For the variable income rolls in the Advanced Game rules,
assume that everyone rolls a "3" for all variable income rolls during
odd numbers years (ie. 1385), and assume that everyone rolls a "4"
on even numbered years (ie. 1386).

X. THE MONEY LENDERS

The Renaissance period witnessed the rise of several fantastically
wealthy and powerful international bankers and financiers. The
impoverished Princes often went to these people for loans, and
often found themselves in great difficulty when the time came to
repay the loans!

A. BORROWING DUCATS: During the Ducat Borrowing Phase,
players may "borrow" ducats by taking the appropriate value in
Ducat units, and adding them to their Treasuries. These loans should
be written down on a piece of scratch paper or some stray space on
the Order Sheet. Record the amount borrowed, the interest rate,
and the date due.

1.  The total number of ducats owed by any one major power may
never exceed twenty-five at one time (not counting interest).

2.  These borrowed ducats may be borrowed for a period of either
one or two years. For instance, a one-year loan taken out in
Summer, 1387 would have to be repaid, with interest, in Summer,
1388. A two-year loan taken out in Fall, 1388 would have to be
repaid, with interest, in Fall, 1390.

3.  One-year loans are at 20% interest on the amount borrowed.
Two-year loans are at 50% interest on the amount borrowed.
When interest is figured, all fractions are rounded up for repay-
ment.

4.  Full amounts, including all interest, must be repaid, even if the
repayment is made early.

B. REPAYING LOANS-PENALTY: Loans plus the interest
must be repaid by the Ducat Borrowing Phase of the due date
Campaign. If not paid in full by this time, the major power
unable to meet its debts will immediately suffer the same effects
as if the player was assassinated. After this, the debt need not be
repaid, but the major power may never again borrow ducats from
the Money Lenders for the rest of the game.

XI. RATINGS POINTS

This rating is intended for players who play the game frequently. It
enables players to compare their overall records with each other.
Only games with four or more players that are finished are counted
in this system.

A. At the end of a game, all players count the number of cities they
control to determine their order of finishing. They then check the
Ratings Chart on the Game Tables Cards to determine how many
ratings points they get. For instance, in a four-player game, the
winner gets ten ratings points, the second place player gets seven
ratings points, etc. In the case of ties, add the ratings points
and divide by the number of tied players to get their ratings points.
For instance, if, in a five-player game three players are tied for
second place (which means they are also tied for third and fourth
place), add the ratings points for second (8), third (6), and fourth
(4), and divide by three. This means all three of the tied players
would get six ratings points.

B. These ratings points are accumulated from game to game. To
find each player's "Skill Rating", divide the total accumulated
points by the number of games played. For instance, the two
players charted below have both participated in ten five-player
games:

                    PLAYER "A"
PLACE           NO. OF TIMES            RATINGS POINTS
-----           ------------            --------------

Second             2                       16
Third               1                       6
Fourth              3                       12
Fifth               2                       4

                    10                      58
Skill Rating 5.8

                    PLAYER "B"
PLACE            NO. OF TIMES            RATINGS POINTS
-----            -----------             --------------

Second                 4                       32
Third                   2                       12

Skill Rating 6.2
Note that although Player "A" won two games while Player "B"
won only once, Player "B" is a slightly more skillful player, as
shown by the two Skill Ratings.

C. A player's Skill Rating can be further expressed by indicating the
number of games played-ie. a rating of "32-5.7" indicates a player
with a Skill Rating of "5.7" after thirty-two games played. To be a
valid indication of overall skills for comparison, the number of
games played by two players must be similar.

D. The ratings points may be used to determine victory in games
involving few players. Instead of one player running several major
powers, but only using one set of unit counters, the player runs each
of the major powers he controls with a separate set of unit counters.
Each of the major powers remains separate, although they are
obviously closely allied! The player should use a separate Order
Sheet for each major power controlled. When the game ends, deter-
mine the order of finishing for all the major powers. A player adds
together the ratings points of the major powers he controls. The
winner of the game is the player with the largest number of ratings
points.

SCENARIOS-HISTORICAL SUMMARY

I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SCENARIOS

The separate scenarios, each of which is a game in itself, all use this
common set of rules. Each scenario provides the information needed
to set up and play a game. There are four separate scenarios pro-
vided, each covering different political alignments in various his-
torical eras. The scenarios are further broken down into variants
which allow for play by different numbers of players. Each scenario
is linked to the next by a running historical commentary. The
essential information given in each scenario is laid out as follows:

DATE: This gives the date of the first Campaign in the scenario.

SET UP: This lists the provinces that are controlled by each of the
major powers (ie. the home countries) at the start of the game.
Provinces that contain military units at the start of the game have
the initial for the type of unit ("A"=Army unit. "F"=Fleet unit,
and "G"=Garrison unit) listed next to the name of the province,
in parenthesis.

AUTONOMOUS GARRISONS: This lists the provinces that contain
Autonomous Garrison units at the start of the game.

SPECIAL RULES: This lists any special rules that apply only to
that scenario. If the special rule is only needed for games using
Advanced rules, the word "Advanced" will appear in parenthesis.

VARIANTS: This tells how to align the major powers to allow for
different numbers of players. When one player is controlling more
than one major power, all the units used by that player should be
the same color. In some cases, a Variant is not suitable for play
using the Basic Game Victory Conditions; If so, it is noted with an
asterisk (*).

II. INDEX TO THE SCENARIOS

This section of the rules is provided to aid players in locating a
scenario variant suitable to the number of players available. It
should be noted that the two player variants, which do not permit
players to interact through negotiations, are provided more as
"practice games" than as serious games.

A. THE EXPANSION OF STATES: 1385-1425: Two, three and
four-player variants.

B. THE BALANCE OF POWER: 1454: Two through eight-player
variants.

C. THE STRUGGLE FOR DOMINANCE: 1499-1521: Three
through six-player variants.

D. THE SPANISH PERPONDERANCE: 1521-1529: Two through
six-player variants.

III. THE SCENARIOS

A. THE EXPANSION OF STATES: 1385-1425: The period from
approximately 1385 to 1425 saw two serious attempts, one by
Milan, the other by Naples, to become mega-states and dominate the
peninsula. While Milan and Naples tried to expand, the Florentines,
realizing that victory by either would cost them their liberty, them-
selves sought to expand in self-defense, and to organize opposition
to Milan and Naples. Venice, which was at the height of its maritime
prosperity, and which up to this time had purposely refrained from
serious involvement on the mainland, grew alarmed at the Milanese
expansion, and decided to acquire its own possessions to act as a
buffer. The Papacy, discredited by the Avignon captivity and the
Great Schism (which saw ignominious counterclaims by three
rival Popes), was not a factor at this time. The various provinces
and cities of the Papal States had reverted to complete autonomy,
and were a tempting target for Neapolitan ambitions. Surrounded
and separated by independent states, the four powers must expand
to survive and triumph.

1.  DATE: Spring, 1385.

2.  SET UP:

MILAN: Pavia (A), Milan (A), Cremona (A), Como, Bologna (A),
and Genoa (F).

VENICE: Dalmatia (F), Venice (G), and Ragusa (F).

NAPLES: Bari (A), Aquila (A), Naples (F), Salerno (F), Otranto,
and Capua.

FLORENCE: Pistoia (A), Florence (A), and Pisa (F).

3.  AUTONOMOUS GARRISONS: Placed on all fortified cities and
fortresses not named as part of the major power's home countries.

4.  SPECIAL RULES
    a. France and Austria are neutral, so no units may enter the pro-
    vinces of Avignon, Marseille, Provence, Swiss, Tyrolea, Austria,
    Carinthia, or Hungary.
    b. Milan, Florence, Venice, and Naples each have one die roll for
    variable income (Advanced).
    c. The player who controls Rome also gets one die roll for variable
    income (Advanced).
    d. The fortresses are used in this scenario.

5.  VARIANTS:
    a. TWO PLAYERS: Each player takes any two of the major powers
    (*).
    b.  THREE PLAYERS: One player takes Milan, one takes Naples,
and one takes Venice and Florence.
c.  FOUR PLAYERS: Each player takes one of the major powers.

B. THE BALANCE OF POWER: 1454: About the year 1454, the
five major Italian powers, having reached a rough parity in strength,
sought to creat an anti-agression peace alliance among themselves.
The geopolitical situations had advanced a great deal since 1400.
Many independent states had been absorbed, and five great states
now dominated the political scene: Venice, Milan, Florence, the
Papal States, and Naples, Venice was now a major land power, as
well as retaining much of her sea empire and mercantile wealth.
Florence had expanded, and now was a sea power as well as a
mercantile power. The Papacy had been restored to Rome, and,
under such dynamic Popes as Martin V, reasserted its sovereignty
over the Papal States. With the resources and contributions of the
faithful all over Europe, the restored, renewed, but now thoroughly
secular Papacy was a force to be reckoned with. Milan, having failed
in its bid to dominate the peninsula was still, under Francesco
Sforza, one of the most powerful centralized Italian States.
Finally, Naples, after being unified once again with Sicily by
Alfonso of Aragon, was now a major maritime and land power.
A new complicating factor was the interest in Italy by outside
powers such as France and Austria, but especially by the Ottoman
Turks. The Turks, unified and expansionistic, fresh from victory at
Constantinople, were ready to move against Venice in the Balkans
or Naples in southern Italy.

    them neutral. Each player then takes any two of the remaining
    major powers.
    OPTION NO. 2: Add the province of Genoa, and treat as a major
    power with one Garrison unit. Each player then takes any three
    major powers.

C. THE STRUGGLE FOR DOMINANCE: 1499-1521: This period
covers the era from the invasion by Louis XII of France in 1499 to
the betrayal of French-controlled Milan to Charles V of Austria in
1521. This was a very confused era of almost continual warfare
touched off by the French invasion, which led to the downfall of
Ludovico il Moro, Duke of Milan, and the French possession of
Milan for nineteen of the next twenty-one years. This period also
saw increasing Spanish and Austrian involvement in Italian affairs.
First the Austrians under Maximilian faced the French in Milan,
then the Aragonese (Spain) under the cynical Ferdinand entered the
affairs of Sicily and Naples, and finally the Emperor Charles V,
ruler of both Spain and Austria, moved to expel the French from
Milan. The different Italian states played a variety of roles during
this period. Florence, embarrassed by internal difficulties, normally
found itself allied with the French against the Papal States and
Naples. Venice survived an attack by all the other states in 1509,
only to see much of its mercantile empire swept away by the
agressive Turks. The Papacy, hoping to remove French influence
from the peninsula, restored the exile Medici as rulers of Florence
and threw its weight into the blance in Spain's favor. Milan,
occupied by France almost the whole time, played no independent
role. This scenario has two parts-one showing the situation in 1499,
and the othe showing the situation in 1513.

    income (Advanced).
    d. Austria, the Papal States, and the Turks each have one die roll
    for variable income (Advanced).
    e. The player who controls Naples or Milan also gets one die roli
    for variable income (Advanced).

5.  VARIANTS:
a.  THREE PLAYERS:
    OPTION NO. 1: Each player takes any two of the major powers (*).
    OPTION NO. 2: One player takes the Papacy and Austria; another
    player takes France and the Turks; the third player takes Venice and
    Florence (*).
b.  FOUR PLAYERS: One player takes Florence and the Papacy;
    another player takes Venice and the Turks, the other two players
    take one of the remaining major powers each.
c.  FIVE PLAYERS: Drop the Turks from the game and make them
    neutral. Each player then takes one of the remaining major powers.
d.  SIX PLAYERS: Each player takes one of the major powers.

PART TWO: The situation in 1513 is very confused and interesting.

Sforza (represented by Milanese units) was allied with the Swiss
and the D'Este family in Modena and Ferrara.

1.  DATE: Spring, 1513.

other players take one of the remaining major powers each.
c. SIX PLAYERS: Each player takes one of the major powers.

D. THE SPANISH PERPONDERANCE: 1521-1529: During the
later stages of the Italian Wars, the power balance situtation was
completely changed from earlier periods. The French had lost their
hold on Milan and Genoa. Spain (linked with Naples) and Austria,
both ruled by the Hapsburg Emperor Charles V, had gained Milan,
and threatened to dominate both Northern and Southern Italy. As
usual, the Italian states took various positions in the struggle.
Venice was menaced by the Turks, and had to devote most of its
attention to its Balkan empire. Florence allied with France to avoid
becoming a vassal of Spain and the Papacy. The Turks were
stronger, conquering Hungary, and threatening to overrun the
Balkans and Southern Italy.

income (Advanced).

5.  VARIANTS:

military units with Autonomous Garrison units. One player takes
France and the Turks, and the other player takes Austria. Both
players then take any one of the remaining two major powers.
b. THREE PLAYERS: One player takes Austria; another player
takes France, the Turks, and Florence; and the third player takes
Venice and the Papacy.

IV. DOING YOUR OWN SCENARIOS

MACHIAVELLI is a very flexible game that easily lends itself to
generating additional scenarios and variants. The scenarios given
with the game are, in fact, only a small part of all the historical
scenarios that could be set up. A little research and imagination
could produce numerous additional scenarios, both historical, and
purely fantastic. Players are therefore encouraged, as they gain
experience with the game, to create their own reality, and
experiment with some additional scenarios.

V. NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI-A SHORT BIOGRAPHY

Niccolo Machiavelli was born in Florence in 1469, and died there in
1527. As a member of a moderately prominent family, Machiavelli
was drawn at an early age into governmental service. From 1498 until
1512, he served in the Chancellery of the Florentine Republic, rising
to become second-in-command and secretary in charge of diplo-
matic negotiations, and, in case of war, the supervision of military
operations. As a diplomat, he travelled to most Italian courts and
to France and Germany. As a military supervisor, he spent a great
deal of time in military camps, closely observing the condottieri
(mercenary soldiers) who dominated the military scene in early
sixteenth century Italy. Having observed the treachery and incon-
stancy of the mercenaries, Machiavelli pushed hard for the organiza-
tion of a Florentine citizen's militia for the defense of the Republic.
He was put in charge of developing this military force, but in 1512
his citizen soldiers were swept from the field by the Imperial
(Austrian) army. The Republic was overthrown, and the Medici
family, in exile since 1494, were reinstated as rulers of Florence.
Because he had organized the militia which opposed their return,
and had been a loyal servant of the Republic, Machiavelli was less
than popular with his new masters. He was dismissed from office,
arrested, tortured, and eventually exiled from the city to a small
estate outside Florence.
Until 1513, Machiavelli's career had been no more, and in many
cases, considerably less, remarkable than that of most of his contem-
pory peers. In exile, however, embittered by his treatment, yet
desperately wanting to rehabilitate his career, Machiavelli began the
most productive, memorable, and creative period of his life. Bet-
ween 1513 and 1523 he wrote the four great treatises on political
thought for which he is principally known: *The Prince, The Dis-
courses, The Art of War,* and *The Florentine History.* Of these *The
Prince* is most famous, for in it Machiavelli developed a systematic
theory of *raison d'etat* which shocked even his contemporaries.
The problem he posed was simply how a Prince was to gain and
hold power. Departing from the superficial and moralistic medieval
manuals on statecraft, Machiavelli advanced the proposition that
politics as a sphere of action was not subject to ordinary moral and
ethical rules. To capture and maintain power, the Prince may use
any methods, and is not bound by ordinary notions of right and
wrong. The highest morality is the secure possession of power, and
any means necessary to obtain that end if appropriate. The Prince
therefore is allowed to, and can without qualms, lie, cheat, murder,
oppress, assassinate, and terrorize his subjects and opponents in
order to preserve his power and the stability of his state. This
concept, that the sphere of politics is ethically distinct from other
spheres of life, and that within the political sphere *raison d'Etat* is
the highest morality; and that to approach this goal the end justifies
any means, constitutes the central message of *The Prince,* and
is the origin of the term Machiavellian.
